# Avenue

This project is a proof of concept to provide a solution for managing documentation that guides the reader based on their input. A walkthrough-based focus on documentation is something I haven't seen in the wild, and there may be good reasons for that. Time will tell!

## Features

- No setup! It all runs in JavaScript on a single page
- Content is written to a JSON file to easily manage a decision flow

## Demo

## Development

* Run `npm install gulp` upon first downloading the repository.
* Make changes in the `/src` directory and run `gulp` to build `/dist/js/script.js` or run `gulp watch` to have it build each time a file is updated in the `/src` directory.
